# HomeAutomationHub
 
Previously I made a [Lighting Controller](https://github.com/chaz393/LightingController) to automate the lights in my room. This was great, but I wanted to add the ability to control other things as well like Unifi Video. Instead of adding a whole new project for that, I decided to make a central hub to make all my calls to, and have the hub run whatever is necessary to do a specific task. I can add "modules" to be controlled by the hub and keep everything separated and easy to debug.
